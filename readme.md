How to use this application (Tibetan Virtual Keyboard)
Click on the Keyboard symbol or icon to activate the virtual Tibetan keyboard.
By default it is Tibetan language, but you can change it into English or number pad by selecting the option.

You can also change the size of keyboard by selecting the number. There are five options in the selection box and 1 for smallest, 3 for medium and 5 for largest size.

Check box that makes the dead key functional or not. It's important to enable the dead key for Tibetan language but you can disable it for english language otherwise letter "a" didn't work.

Clear button is to reset the form or delete the text.

To hide the keyboard press the Cross button
To write སྐྱ་ click on the word ས་ a ཀ་ a ཡ but don't forget to check that check box་ to enable dead key - a (by default it's already checked)
To enable the words that are under SHIFT you have to click on SHIFT, it automatically shows up the words.

Keyboard layout is same as TCRC Bodyig layout.
